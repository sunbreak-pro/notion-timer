/**
 * Module-level in-memory selection store for the Connect section (#1473).
 *
 * The Connect body (`web/src/connect/ConnectScreen.tsx`) is mounted inside the
 * section switch in `web/src/sectionDescriptors.tsx`, so leaving the section
 * UNMOUNTS it and takes its component-local "which tag" state with it. Every
 * other section keeps what the user had open across a section switch —
 * Materials through `materialsSelectionStore` (#282), the Calendar and the
 * lifted Analytics tab through the shell — and Connect was the one that came
 * back blank. This store is the same idiom as #282's: module scope outlives
 * any single React tree, so a remounted ConnectScreen can re-open the tag the
 * user last picked.
 *
 * Session-scoped on purpose. It resets on app restart (module state is fresh
 * per process) — a tag id from a previous run may no longer exist, and the
 * Issue asks for "leave and come back", not "close and reopen the app".
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free: no React, no localStorage.
