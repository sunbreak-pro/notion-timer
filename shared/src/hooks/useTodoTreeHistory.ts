   * is a faithful reversal: a status flip, a reorder, a soft delete are all
   * field changes on rows that stay in the list, so writing the old values
   * back IS the undo. A create is the one write whose reversal is an ABSENCE,
   * and an upsert has no way to say that — the new row went into the DB with
   * the first sync and the second sync, not naming it, left it exactly as it
   * was. On screen the node vanished (setNodes), then Realtime echoed the
   * write back, the tree re-read, and the todo was standing there again with
   * the Undo button already spent (#1485: the Schedule creation panel's Todo
   * tab, but the Todos board's own add took the same path).
   *
   * So the undo names the row: the list from before goes back as it always
   * did (the siblings the create shifted down get their order back), and
   * then the created row itself is removed. Redo is the plain re-persist —
   * the row's node is in `after`, and the upsert writes it back with
   * `is_deleted: false` (toItemsMetaInsertRow materialises the column), which
   * is why a soft delete is enough for the removal and the id survives the
   * round trip.
