/**
 * How much vertical room a segment takes (#1039).
 *
 *  - "md" — the original. Every in-panel use (schedule editors, the sidebar
 *    tab pair) keeps it: those sit in their own boxes where 4px changes
 *    nothing, and shrinking the type there would just make them harder to read.
 *    The sidebar tabs do end up a step smaller since #1343, but not for
 *    density — see `singleLineLabels`, where the type is part of what buys
 *    three long labels a single row.
 *  - "sm" — the mobile SECTION tab band, which is a different problem. It runs
 *    the full width at the very top of every narrow screen, so its height is
 *    subtracted from the content on all seven sections at once ("要素を圧迫
 *    している"). One step down on the type and a slightly tighter gutter take
 *    the band from 36px to 32px.
 *
 * The touch target does NOT follow the box down: "sm" carries TAP_TARGET_TALL,
 * which hangs an invisible 44px hit area over the smaller pill. The band
 * therefore ends up EASIER to hit than it was before this size existed (36px),
 * while reading as less furniture.
 *
 * #1512 re-measured this band at 33px and filed it as an undersized target.
 * It is NOT one, and the size table is deliberately unchanged: the audit read
 * `getBoundingClientRect()` on the button, which cannot see a ::after, and the
 * hit area it missed is the 44px one above. Growing the pill to match the
 * number would put back the very height #1039 was asked to remove ("要素を
 * 圧迫している") — so the fix stayed on the row's ICON buttons, whose targets
 * were short in a way a pseudo-element could not repair (Undo/Redo sit
 * gap-0.5 apart, so widening their hit areas would overlap each other).
 *
 * That change makes this band's overhang free, as a side effect worth knowing:
 * the row is now as tall as the 44px ::after, so the ~6px it used to hang past
 * the track — the part TAP_TARGET_TALL's own doc-comment asks callers to check
 * their surroundings for — no longer reaches past the row at all.

 * is a plain string join: two px-* classes on the same button do not resolve
 * "last one wins", they let Tailwind's emit order decide (the #830 bug class,
 * `.claude/rules/frontend.md` §Gotchas). Exactly one padding class and one
 * type class must reach the element, so the caller picks a whole row.
 *
 * The padding is nearly free here: segments are flex-1, so their width comes
 * from the track and the label is centred inside whatever it gets — px-1.5
 * only lowers the floor a long label is allowed to reach, it does not move a
 * short one. The type step is the part that is actually visible, and it is
 * small (text-xs is lifted to 0.8125rem in tokens.css, so ~14.6px against
 * text-sm's ~15.8px at the default 18px root). Both together are what buy

   * 本日の Todo / 繰り返し, en Today's flow / Today's Todo / Repeats) share a
   * 320px panel, which leaves roughly 67px of text room per segment at the
   * default 18px root. The two long ones broke mid-label (「今日の流」+「れ」,

   * stopped looking like one control. #1207 aligned the broken labels; it did
   * not stop them breaking.

   * The answer is the one #1264 already reached for the tour footer: the text
   * is nowrap and the ROW is what gives. CJK offers a break between any two
   * glyphs, so a squeezed flex row will always find one — refusing the break
   * has to come first, and something else then has to absorb the overrun.
   * Here that is flex-wrap on the track: at the panel's 240px minimum, or at
   * the top of the font-size slider, the segments fall into two rows with
   * every label still intact, instead of one row of shredded ones.
   *
   * Not the default. The other four call sites already fit on one line, and
   * FrequencyEditor's en "Every N days" — four segments inside a phone-width
   * sheet — is a label that genuinely should keep wrapping.
