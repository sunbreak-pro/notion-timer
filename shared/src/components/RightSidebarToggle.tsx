/*
 * RightSidebarToggle — opens/closes the detail panel (App Shell Turn 2).
 *
 *  variant "panel"     — Desktop: sits at the right end of the header-tab row
 *                        (28×28). Open = accent text + accent-subtle fill;
 *                        closed = neutral with a hover surface. The GLYPH
 *                        flips with the state (#1284), mirroring what the left
 *                        sidebar's collapse button has always done (SidebarNav:
 *                        PanelLeftOpen while collapsed, PanelLeftClose while
 *                        expanded) — so both ends of the shell answer "what
 *                        will this click do?" the same way. Since #1284 it is
 *                        also the panel's ONLY close affordance on Desktop.
 *  variant "hamburger" — Mobile: sits at the left end of the segment row
 *                        (PanelRight, bordered) and opens the drawer.
 *                        Static glyph on purpose — the drawer is modal and
 *                        covers this button, so there is no open state for it
 *                        to reflect (the variant name is kept to avoid churn
 *                        at the call sites).
 *                        Floored to the 44px touch target (#1512). It used to
 *                        be a 2rem box carrying TAP_TARGET_TALL, which bought
 *                        the height but not the WIDTH — inset-x-0 holds that
 *                        pseudo-element to the control's own 2rem, so a thumb
 *                        still had a 36px-wide strip to find. The box itself
 *                        is the target now, and TAP_TARGET_TALL came off
 *                        because it would be exactly the height the box
 *                        already has.
 *                        This is the branch that sets the narrow row's height
 *                        together with Undo/Redo; #1039's shorter SEGMENT
 *                        BAND is untouched and still reads as the smaller
 *                        furniture it was shrunk to be.
 *
 * aria-expanded reflects isOpen, and the aria-label flips with it (open ↔
 * close action) so the announced action always matches what a click will do.
 * Copy injected already-translated (§6.4). lumen-* tokens only (§5).
