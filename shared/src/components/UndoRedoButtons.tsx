/*
 * `max-md:min-h-11 max-md:min-w-11` — the 44px touch floor, below the app's
 * single breakpoint only (#1512).
 *
 * Conditional because this ONE component draws both pairs: the Desktop header
 * row (web/src/HeaderUndoRedo.tsx) and the narrow header row, where the audit
 * measured 36×36. A 2rem mouse target is right on Desktop and too small for a
 * thumb, so the floor has to be the narrow branch's alone.
 *
 * Growing the BOX, not hanging a pseudo-element over it the way
 * TAP_TARGET_TALL does: these two sit `gap-0.5` apart, so a hit area wide
 * enough to matter would reach across onto its neighbour — and Undo landing on
 * Redo is worse than either being small. That is the surrounding-check the
 * TAP_TARGET_TALL doc-comment asks for, coming out the other way.
 *
 * min-* rather than max-md:size-11 because `cn`/plain strings do not resolve
 * two utilities of one property by call order (#830); min-height/min-width are
 * separate properties and beat `size-8` in the used-value calculation.
 *
 * `max-md:` is the same lever ItemLinkMenu and SlashMenu already use for this
 * exact floor, so it is what this follows. Its one known cost, stated plainly
 * because tokens.css:604 warns about it: the variant is REM-based (48rem =
 * 864px at the default 18px root) while the shell switches layouts on a literal
 * 768px, so between those two widths a Desktop window draws the wide header
 * with the mobile-sized pair. Nothing breaks — the wide header is 3.75rem, so
 * they still fit — and pinning it instead would mean inventing a second
 * breakpoint convention for one button pair.
