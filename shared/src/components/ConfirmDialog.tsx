 * ConfirmDialog (#707) — the in-app replacement for the browser's own
 * `confirm` / `alert`. Since #781 nothing in shared/ or web/ calls those any
 * more: every question and every refusal on screen is this component.
 *
 * A native dialog is drawn by the browser, so it lands outside the theme, the
 * fonts and the lumen-* tokens: while both kinds were in use, two questions on
 * the same screen looked like they came from two different applications. It
 * also freezes the page, which is why Playwright cannot get past one. (The
 * repeat-delete guard used to be the in-app half of that contrast; since #1279
 * it is simply another caller of this component.)
 *
 * Two shapes, told apart by `cancelLabel` alone rather than by a `variant`
 * flag — one source of truth for "can this be refused", with no second boolean
 * to fall out of step:
 *   with cancelLabel    — a question (the `confirm`)
 *   without cancelLabel — a statement to acknowledge (the `alert`)
 *
 * Pure presentation (§3.1 / §6.4): copy arrives already translated, both
 * answers are callbacks. lumen-* tokens only, opaque panel via <Modal>.

 * must still be claimed synchronously once the answer arrives (#434) — the
 * dialog covers the page while it is open, but nothing else does.
 *
 * A second question asked while one is on screen is REFUSED (resolves `false`)
 * rather than queued or allowed to replace the pending one: replacing it would
 * leave the first caller waiting forever, and `false` is the safe answer
 * everywhere here — it declines a conversion, a delete, and a discard alike.
 * The realistic way to reach it is a double Escape on the editor, before the
 * first dialog has painted.
 *
 * If the host unmounts with a question pending the promise never settles, so
 * the continuation — and its write — simply never runs. That is the intended
 * outcome: the surface that asked is gone.
