 * (web/src/briefing/BriefingScreen.tsx) fetches + aggregates and injects

 * 朱 lumen-briefing-shu for "today / action" marks, 琥珀 lumen-briefing-kohaku
 * for context / annotations. All colors are lumen-* tokens (no hardcodes).
 *
 * The visual zone —「きのうまでの自分」, the three adopted Analytics widgets —
 * used to be one of these sections. It lives in the shared detail panel now
 * (#938 → BriefingVizPanel.tsx): everything the paper prints is about today,
 * and three backward-looking charts in the middle of it kept breaking that
