/*
 * Web Notes tab (life-tags unification S1). The former folder tree is gone:
 * the side list now GROUPS active notes under a heading per life-tag (name-
 * sorted, color dot) plus a trailing "untagged" bucket. Grouping keys off tag
 * assignments only (buildTagGroups, shared) — NOT the tree position — so a
 * nested note stays fully visible. #375 retired the folder note type itself;
 * legacy folder rows are dropped at fetch time and never reach this view.
 *
 * ONE LAYOUT, TWO WIDTHS (#876, ユーザー裁定 D-20260815-materials-2 = A). The
 * MAIN content is the selected note's detail — title, tags, pin, delete and the
 * TipTap body — and the grouped list is the detail PANEL's content at both
 * widths, pushed there through <RightSidebarPortal>. Wide draws that panel as
 * the push-in rightSidebar; narrow draws the same content in the <MobileDrawer>
 * the section header's hamburger opens (`narrowHeader: "tabs+hamburger"` in
 * sectionDescriptors), so "list → pick → write in the main area" is one flow
 * rather than two.
 *
 * What #876 retired: the 92%-then-fullscreen detail BottomSheet (#471) and the
 * separate mobile list surface that opened it. With the main area showing the
 * body, the sheet was a second window onto the same note. Deleting it also
 * removed the sheet's own note identity (`useNoteSheetTarget`) — the reason
 * that existed was that the sheet opened a note SYNCHRONOUSLY while the list
 * carries no bodies, so it needed its own `isContentLoaded` gate or the editor
 * mounted over an empty body and saved that emptiness (#475). The selection
 * never had that hole: `selectNote` hydrates the body BEFORE flipping the id
 * (useNotesUnifiedAPI), so a surface keyed on `selectedNote` cannot open early.
 *
 * Narrow keeps ONE thing of its own: the compact detail `variant` (the sheet's
 * title sizing, not the page-level one). Creating is now identical at both
 * widths — #1147 retired the narrow title-first <QuickAddSheet>, so "+" makes
 * an Untitled note and opens the editor on a phone exactly as the Desktop pill
 * always has.
 *
 * Both halves render the SAME derived list (search → tag groups → sort → tag
 * filter) off the same state, so the two breakpoints never disagree (#369).
 *
 * Data stays context-side (useNotesUnifiedContext / useWikiTagsUnifiedContext);
 * this view is DataService-free (§3.1) and takes copy from useTranslation →
 * props.
 *
 * Split (#588). This file is the HOST: it owns the state both surfaces read,
 * the i18n → props hand-off, and the breakpoint switch. The pieces:
 *   - hooks/useNoteListState — the derived list pipeline + sort/filter/collapse
 *   - hooks/useNoteLinking   — "[[" plumbing + cross-tab selection handoff
 *   - hooks/useNotePassword  — the password dialog + unlocked set
 *   - NotesSidebarList       — the list surface (the panel's content)
 *   - NoteDetailSurface      — the detail panel the main area hosts
 *   - NoteListRows           — the draggable row + droppable heading
