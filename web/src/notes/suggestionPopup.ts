/*
 * Placement for the editor's floating suggestion menus ("[[" item links and "/"
 * blocks). Both used to be pinned straight under the caret:
 *
 *     popup.style.top = `${rect.bottom + window.scrollY + 6}px`
 *
 * which is fine on a desktop window and wrong on a phone (#471). Two reasons:
 * the visible area is only the part of the page the soft keyboard has not
 * covered, and a caret sitting in the lower half of a tall bottom sheet leaves
 * no room below it at all — the menu opened underneath the keyboard, where it
 * could neither be read nor tapped.
 *
 * So the menu is placed against the VISIBLE area instead of the window:
 * `visualViewport` is the browser's own measurement of what the user can
 * actually see (it shrinks when the keyboard opens, and offsets when the page
 * is pinch-scrolled), with `window.inner*` as the fallback for anything that
 * does not implement it. When the menu does not fit below the caret it flips
 * above, and either way it is capped to the space on that side so it scrolls
 * internally instead of running off the screen.
 *
 * The geometry is a pure function so it can be tested without a layout — jsdom
 * has none (rules/frontend.md §テスト環境の制約), and this is exactly the kind
 * of arithmetic that silently breaks.

   *   - Typing narrows the candidate list, so the menu shrinks; a menu that was
   *     flipped above should slide back down against the caret.
   *
   * No feedback loop: this writes top/left, and the cap it may send is skipped
