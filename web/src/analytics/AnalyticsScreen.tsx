/*
 * Analytics host shell (W4 · lean). Mirrors the Work/Trash host pattern: the
 * host owns data fetching (it calls the injected DataService — §6.4 allows
 * hosts) and i18n `t` resolution, then injects both into the pure shared
 * <AnalyticsView>. The shared tree never calls useTranslation / getDataService.
 *
 * Data surface (only what the 4 kept tabs need): timer sessions, todo tree,
 * today's schedule items (Overview), every live event (`fetchEvents()` — the
 * Overview tag usage card's range-independent totals, #1379), routines, notes,
 * tags + tag assignments (unified API — Overview counts and the Todos tab's tag
 * work-time ring, #334), and the pomodoro daily target from timer settings. The
 * Schedule tab's items are fetched separately, per selected date range (see the
 * scheduleRange effect + AnalyticsView.onScheduleRangeChange), so we no longer
 * load all history up front.
 *
 * Both loads run through `useDomainLoad` (#1157). Before that they were two
 * hand-written effects keyed on `[ds]` / `[ds, scheduleRange]`, which had two
 * consequences: the dashboard skeleton came back on every return to the
 * section (#1038 §3.1), and nothing here declared a Sync domain, so the
 * numbers never moved until the screen was remounted (#1136). The mount load
 * now replays its last result from the `analyticsSummary` slot before paint
 * and re-reads behind it, and both loads follow `useSyncDomains`.
 *
 * v2 §1 adoption (#208): the Overview/Todos/Work/Schedule tab band is lifted
 * into the shell's standard SectionHeader (MainScreen owns `analyticsTab`, same
 * as Materials / Schedule). This host just forwards that tab state down to the
 * pure <AnalyticsView>; the shared view then drops its in-body tab band and
 * keeps only the date-range preset.
