/*
 * Work — Layout Standard v2 adoption (#590).
 *
 * The section header is NOT the screen's to draw: MainScreen mounts the
 * standard <SectionHeader> in AppShell's wide-only header slot, and the shell
 * PageContainer owns width/gutter/scroll. What that leaves for this suite is
 * the half a unit test can actually hold still:
 *
 *   - the body adds no title row of its own, so the shell header is the only
 *     place the section is named (a duplicate title is exactly what the other
 *     v2 adoptions — Settings #211, Connect #212 — went in to delete);
 *   - PomodoroSettings, which lives in the detail panel rather than in the
 *     body, still opens and closes now that the panel opens BELOW the header's
 *     divider (v2 §4);
 *   - nothing the header carries is lost below 768px, where AppShell renders
 *     no header at all — the timer is Mobile-Full (mobile-scope.md #10), so
 *     both the todo picker and the settings have to stay reachable.
 *
 * The harness rebuilds the shell around WorkScreen (header row + main + panel)
 * instead of rendering MainScreen, which would need a Supabase session and
 * every global Provider. The timer itself is a local stub rather than the real
 * TimerProvider: that Provider needs a Sync Provider above it, and #590 is
 * explicitly not to touch TimerContext (a different lane owns it).
 *
 * SPACING is not asserted here: jsdom has no layout (rules/frontend.md), so
 * gutters and gaps are chat-main's post-merge browser check (CLAUDE.md §7.4).
