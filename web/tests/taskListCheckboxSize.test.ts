/*
 * #1183 → #1368 — the task-list checkbox is sized, and sized to MATCH.
 *
 * This is a stylesheet-only rule with no DOM to assert against: jsdom has no
 * layout (CLAUDE.md §7.1), so a rendered checkbox measures 0×0 whatever the CSS
 * says, and the rule can be dropped in a merge without a single suite going
 * red. Reading the source text is the only check available — the same shape
 * fieldFontFloorLockstep.test.ts uses for the mobile font floor.
 *
 * What changed with #1368 is the UNIT, and why. #1183 sized it in `em` so it
 * tracked the editor's font, which the mobile floor raises (#1134). The size
 * that matters now is the one every OTHER todo checkbox draws — the paper's
 * carryover rows and the Schedule tray both render <TodoStatusCheckbox> — and
 * that is a px. So the lockstep runs across the package boundary: the number in
 * the stylesheet has to be the number the component exports, and this file is
 * what fails when someone changes one of them.
 *
 * #883's constraint survives the switch and is asserted below: the box still
 * has to fit inside the 1.6em line box its label centres it in, or it stops
 * sitting on the first line of its own text.
