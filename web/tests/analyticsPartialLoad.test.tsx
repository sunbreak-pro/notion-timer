/*
 * The Analytics host's mount load when its sources do not all answer (#1524).
 *
 * The nine reads used to be bundled with `Promise.all`, so the FIRST rejection
 * threw the other eight answers away, the screen fell back to its all-zero
 * EMPTY, and nothing on it said why. On 2026-09-05 that turned one missing
 * migration on `timer_sessions` into a dashboard reporting no todos, no events
 * and no notes — zeros the user had no way to tell from real ones.
 *
 * shared/tests cannot see any of this: those suites take the numbers in as
 * props. The behaviour lives entirely in this host's fetch, which is why the
 * regression needs a web suite.
 *
 * Both widths are exercised, because they fail differently. Desktop keeps its
 * cards and just loses one card's number; Mobile, when NOTHING loads, hits its
 * "nothing recorded yet" empty state — the exact screen that must not claim
 * the user has no records.
 *
 * No jest-dom in web/ — presence comes from getBy* throwing, absence from
 * queryBy* being null.
