/*
 * #1174 — Settings as CATEGORIES.
 *
 * The screen grew a second axis: the rightSidebar face lists the categories
 * and the body below shows one of them. Two things about that are easy to get
 * wrong and invisible to the primitives' own suites, which never see the
 * screen that wires them:
 *
 *   - a category row swaps the BODY. Every card that used to be on screen at
 *     once now depends on `tab`, so a row that fails to switch (or a body that
 *     forgets to hide) reads as "the setting disappeared".
 *   - the Tips row is NOT a category. It raises a centred dialog and must
 *     leave the body it was pressed from exactly where it was — the one row in
 *     the list whose press means something different from all the others.
 *
 * `RightSidebarPortal` is stubbed to render inline, the way the other Settings
 * suites do: without a RightSidebarProvider the real one renders nothing, and
 * the nav under test would never reach the document.
 *
 * No jest-dom in web/ — presence comes from getBy* throwing, absence from
 * queryBy* being null.
